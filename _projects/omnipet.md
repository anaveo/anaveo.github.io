This was one of my first major engineering projects. I created this to gain a further understanding of IoT, interactive machines and the Raspberry Pi. By utilizing MQTT and Node-RED software, the device was able to be controlled from anywhere in the world and could stream a camera feed to a user, allowing them to monitor their pets when not at home.

*Note: Due to the age of this project (made in 2016), little documentation is available. I've switched alot of phones/laptops since so looks like its lost to time.*
