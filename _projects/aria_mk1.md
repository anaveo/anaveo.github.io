The aim of this project was to create a fully portable power generation turbine for use in remote locations. Aria was designed to be compact, efficient and easy to assemble.  

The turbine is built for hikers, rangers, and remote personnel to charge their cellphones/personal electronics.

Aria was designed with portability in mind. When its blades are folded, the turbine has a diameter of under 4". A 1-liter bottle is shown for scale.  



### System Design

The electrical system can be accessed by pulling the assembly from the rear of the turbine. It uses an IR sensor to determine RPM, a 12V motor as a generator, and a 4.8V 4000 mAh battery pack to store energy.
