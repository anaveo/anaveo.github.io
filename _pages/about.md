I’m Om Anavekar, an engineer and tinkerer who loves building things at the intersection of hardware, software, and AI. I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University (Class of 2026). I enjoy diving into both the nitty-gritty of embedded programming and the bigger picture of how technology can solve real problems.

This site is a place to share some of my past work as well as fun hobby projects I’ve been exploring lately. For me, building is about curiosity, learning, and creating things that are useful (or just cool).
